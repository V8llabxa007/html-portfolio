<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>

<p>I am Dronamraju Sri Vallabha, a graduate of Delhi Public School Hyderabad. </p>

<p>I have been learning carnatic music since I was 4 years old. I have been performing in various ethnic activities, such as School events, Community events etc, whenever I got an opportunity.</p>

<p>I am an NCC [airforce] cadet. I have written and received the ‘A-Certificate’ through my school.
I am also a sports person. I have trained in Badminton for 3 years. I have participated in tournaments too.
I am also a fitness enthusiast. I do hypertrophy weight training.
I am also an MUN enthusiast. Throughout my school I have participated and won many prizes in the Model UN.</p>




<p>Since my childhood, I have visited many countries around the world. These include Germany, Russia, France, Italy, USA, UK, etc. I have also visited various states of India - Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, etc. Whichever place I visit, I prefer to learn about the place’s culture, history, facts, etc.</p>

<p>My favourite site is the Nobel prize Museum of Stockholm, Sweden. The Museum’s aim is to spread knowledge and create interest and discussion around the natural sciences and culture through creative learning, exhibition techniques and modern technology.
The Nobel Prize Museum illustrates a century of creativity, where visitors can follow the changes of the 20th century through the Nobel Prize and the Nobel Prize laureates.</p>


<p>I am also associated with the EQUIPPP foundation.
EQUIPPP, brings precious literature and circulates it to the stakeholders across various regions.
In 2019, as a volunteer, I participated in the Indian Book launch event of the book- “Social Value Investing”, by noting the attendance of the audience, circulating book copies and making introductions with various businessmen.</p> 

<p>The book was authored by Prof. William B. Emiche and Howard W. Buffett.
It proposes a cross-sector collaboration between philanthropists, Government and Industrial Corporates. I spent time with Prof. William Emiche and he apprised me about how different associations work hand in hand to create social impact.</p>

<p>I have been, in many instances, ruminating about different social challenges and how they are addressed, by the government, Non profits, philanthropists, etc.</p>
